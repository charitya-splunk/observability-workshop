Introduction The goal of this workshop is to experience an issue and use Splunk Observability Cloud to troubleshoot and identify the root cause. For this, we have provided a complete microservices based application running in Kubernetes that has been instrumented to send metrics, traces, and logs to Splunk Observability Cloud.
2. OpenTelemetry A Quick introduction to why OpenTelemetry and why is it important for Observability.
3. A tour of the Splunk Observability User Interface A walkthrough of the various components of Splunk Observability Cloud showing you how to easily navigate the 5 main components:- Infrastructure, RUM, APM, Logs, and Synthetics.</description></item><item><title>Why OpenTelemetry?</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.12/en/s4r/20-opentelemetry/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.12/en/s4r/20-opentelemetry/index.html</guid><description>OpenTelemetry explained OpenTelemetry, an open-source project created by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), is a set of tools and libraries that help software developers gather information about how their applications are performing and behaving. It&amp;rsquo;s like a set of instruments that allows you to monitor and measure what&amp;rsquo;s happening inside your software, so you can understand its behaviour, identify issues, and optimize its performance, not unlike your local car mechanic.</description></item><item><title>Signing in to Splunk Observability Cloud</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.12/en/s4r/30-initial-tour/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.12/en/s4r/30-initial-tour/index.html</guid><description>2 minutes This section will get you logged in and introduce you to the Splunk Observability Cloud UI.
1. Sign in to Splunk Observability Cloud You should have received an e-mail from Splunk inviting you to the Workshop Org (Org is short for Organization).
This e-mail will look like the one below, if you cannot find it please check your Spam/Junk folders, check our FAQ here or inform your Instructor.</description></item><item><title>Shopping at the Online Boutique</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.12/en/s4r/40-online-boutique/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.12/en/s4r/40-online-boutique/index.html</guid><description>The purpose of this exercise is for you to interact with the Online Boutique web application. This is a sample application that is used to demonstrate the capabilities of Splunk Observability Cloud. The application is a simple e-commerce site that allows you to browse items, add them to your cart, and then checkout.

IT Operations and Engineering teams can quickly scope, prioritize and isolate errors, measure how performance impacts real users and optimize end-user experiences by correlating performance metrics alongside video reconstructions of all user interactions.</description></item><item><title>Splunk APM</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.12/en/s4r/60-apm/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.12/en/s4r/60-apm/index.html</guid><description>Splunk APM provides a NoSample™ end-to-end visibility of every service and its dependency to solve problems quicker across monoliths and microservices. Teams can immediately detect problems from new deployments, confidently troubleshoot by scoping and isolating the source of an issue, and optimize service performance by understanding how backend services impact end users and business workflows.
Real-time monitoring and alerting: Splunk provides a 10-second resolution on metrics to detect and alert on issues when they happen.</description></item><item><title>Splunk Log Observer</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.12/en/s4r/70-log-observer/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.12/en/s4r/70-log-observer/index.html</guid><description>Log Observer Connect allows you to seamlessly bring in the same log data from your Splunk Platform into an intuitive and codeless interface designed to help you find and fix problems quickly. You can easily perform log-based analysis and seamlessly correlate your logs with Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring’s real-time metrics and Splunk APM traces in one place.
End-to-end visibility: By combining the powerful logging capabilities of Splunk Platform with Splunk Observability Cloud’s traces and real-time metrics for deeper insights and more context of your hybrid environment.</description></item><item><title>Splunk Synthetics</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.12/en/s4r/80-synthetics/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.12/en/s4r/80-synthetics/index.html</guid><description>Splunk Synthetic Monitoring provides visibility across URLs, APIs and critical web services to solve problems faster. IT Operations and engineering teams can easily detect, alert and prioritize issues, simulate multi-step user journeys, measure business impact from new code deployments and optimize web performance with guided step-by-step recommendations to ensure better digital experiences.
Ensure Availability: Proactively monitor and alert on the health and availability of critical services, URLs and APIs with customizable browser tests to simulate multi-step workflows that make up the user experience.</description></item><item><title>War Room Dashboard</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.12/en/s4r/90-war-room/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.12/en/s4r/90-war-room/index.html</guid><description>WIP WIP WIP WIP WIP</description></item><item><title>Workshop Wrap-up</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.12/en/s4r/100-wrap-up/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.12/en/s4r/100-wrap-up/index.html</guid><description>This wraps up the Splunk for Rookies Workshop of the Splunk Observability Cloud. We were able to:
Understand what real users were experiencing See how we can detect these issues through Detectors, Dashboards and Synthetic Tests Troubleshoot a particularly long page load, by following its trace across the front and back end and right to the log entries. Use Tag Spotlight, in both RUM and APM, to understand blast radius and context for our performance issues and errors.</description></item></channel></rss>
