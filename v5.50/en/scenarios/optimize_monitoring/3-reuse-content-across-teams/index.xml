Moreover, due to the absence of a standardized troubleshooting workflow, teams often resort to creating numerous custom dashboards, each resembling the other in structure and content. As a result, administrative overhead skyrockets and MTTR slows.</description></item><item><title>Dashboard Mirroring</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.50/en/scenarios/optimize_monitoring/3-reuse-content-across-teams/3-mirror-dashboards/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.50/en/scenarios/optimize_monitoring/3-reuse-content-across-teams/3-mirror-dashboards/index.html</guid><description>Not only do the out-of-the-box dashboards provide rich visibility into the infrastructure that is being monitored they can also be mirrored. This is important because it enables you to create standard dashboards for use by teams throughout your organization. This allows all teams to see any changes to the charts in the dashboard, and members of each team can set dashboard variables and filter customizations relevant to their requirements.
Exercise: Create a Mirrored Dashboard While on the Kubernetes Pods dashboard, you created in the previous step, In the upper right corner of the dashboard click the Dashboard actions button (3 horizontal dots) -&amp;gt; Click Add a mirror&amp;hellip;.</description></item></channel></rss>
