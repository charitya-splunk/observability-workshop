Starting with a single page browser test will let us capture how first- and third-party resources impact how our end users experience our browser-based site. It also allows us to start to understand our user experience metrics before introducing the complexity of multiple steps in one test.
A page where your users commonly “land” is a good choice to start with a single page test. This could be your site homepage, a section main page, or any other high-traffic URL that is important to you and your end users.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><atom:link href="https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.71/en/scenarios/optimize_end_user_experiences/1-synthetics/3-browser/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
