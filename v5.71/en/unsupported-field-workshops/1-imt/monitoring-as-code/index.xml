Run Terraform to create detectors and dashboards from code using the Splunk Terraform Provider. See how Terraform can also delete detectors and dashboards. 1. Initial setup Monitoring as code adopts the same approach as infrastructure as code. You can manage monitoring the same way you do applications, servers, or other infrastructure components.
You can use monitoring as code to build out your visualizations, what to monitor, and when to alert, among other things.
