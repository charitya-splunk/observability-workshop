In order to simplify the workshop modules, a pre-configured AWS/EC2 instance is provided.
The instance is pre-configured with all the software required to deploy the Splunk OpenTelemetry Connector2 in Kubernetes, deploy a NGINX3 ReplicaSet4 and finally deploy a microservices based application which has been instrumented using OpenTelemetry to send metrics, traces, spans and logs5.</description></item><item><title>Splunk4Rookies - Observability</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.11/en/s4r/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.11/en/s4r/index.html</guid><description>In this workshop we will be showing how Splunk Observability Cloud provides instant visibility of the user experience – from the perspective of the front end application to its backing services – showing off some of the most compelling product features, and differentiators of the Splunk Observability Cloud Suite:
Complete end to end trace visibility with Application Performance Monitoring (APM) Real User Monitoring (RUM) NoSample™ Full-fidelity tracing Logs and Metrics Finding root-cause with tag analytics and error stacks Infinite Cardinality Related content One of the core tenets in building the Splunk Observability Cloud is unifying telemetry data to build a complete picture of a user’s experience and your application stack.</description></item><item><title>Splunk APM</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.11/en/apm/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.11/en/apm/index.html</guid><description>Splunk APM is a NoSample™ Full-fidelity application performance monitoring and troubleshooting solution for cloud-native, microservices-based applications.
By collecting all traces, instead of a sampled subset, no anomaly goes undetected. Whether a user experiences an error or longer-than-usual latency, you’ll be able to know and act on it within seconds. Furthermore, not all bad behavior results in errors — as your developers create new applications they need to know whether their canary releases provide the expected results.</description></item><item><title>Splunk RUM</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.11/en/rum/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.11/en/rum/index.html</guid><description>Splunk RUM is the industry’s only end to end, full fidelity Real User Monitoring solution. It is built to optimize performance and aid in faster troubleshooting, giving you full visibility into end-user experiences.
Splunk RUM allows you to identify performance problems in your Web and or Mobile applications that impact the customer experience. We support benchmarking and measuring page performance with core web vitals. This includes but not limited to: W3C timings, the ability to identify long running tasks, along with everything that can impact your page load.</description></item><item><title>Ninja Workshops</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.11/en/other/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.11/en/other/index.html</guid><description>PetClinic Java WorkshopA workshop using Zero Configuration Auto-Instrumentation for Java.

Dimension, Properties and TagsOne conversation that frequently comes up is Dimensions vs Properties and when you should use one verus the other.
Naming Conventions for Tagging with OpenTelemetry and SplunkWhen deploying OpenTelemetry in a large organization, it’s critical to define a standardized naming convention for tagging, and a governance process to ensure the convention is adhered to.</description></item><item><title>Workshop Setup</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.11/en/workshop-setup/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.11/en/workshop-setup/index.html</guid><description>Workshop Setup Steps Available Workshop Orgs The following Orgs are used for running Observability Workshops.
