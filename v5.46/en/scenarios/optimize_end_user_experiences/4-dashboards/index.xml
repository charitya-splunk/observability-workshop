What&amp;rsquo;s better? KPIs in context with events! Overlaying events on a dashboard can help us more quickly understand if an event like a deployment caused a change in metrics, for better or worse.
Your instructor will push a condition change to the workshop application. Click the event marker on any of your dashboard charts to see more details. In the dimensions, we can see more details about this specific event.</description></item></channel></rss>
