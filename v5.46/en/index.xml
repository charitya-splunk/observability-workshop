Infrastructure Monitoring Full-fidelity Real User Monitoring (RUM) Complete end-to-end NoSample™ Full-fidelity trace visibility with Application Performance Monitoring (APM) No code log querying Synthetic Monitoring Finding root causes with tag analytics and error stacks Related content A key factor in building the Splunk Observability Cloud is to unify telemetry data to create a complete picture of an end-user experience and your application stack.</description></item><item><title>Scenarios</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.46/en/scenarios/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.46/en/scenarios/index.html</guid><description>Optimize Cloud MonitoringThe elasticity of cloud architectures means that monitoring artifacts must scale elastically as well, breaking the paradigm of purpose-built monitoring assets. As a result, administrative overhead, visibility gaps, and tech debt skyrocket while MTTR slows. This typically happens for three reasons: Complex and Inefficient Data Management: Infrastructure data is scattered across multiple tools with inconsistent naming conventions, leading to fragmented views and poor metadata and labeling. Managing multiple agents and data flows adds to the complexity.</description></item><item><title>Ninja Workshops</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.46/en/other/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.46/en/other/index.html</guid><description>Splunk IMSplunk delivers real-time monitoring and troubleshooting to help you maximize infrastructure performance with complete visibility.

Dimension, Properties and TagsOne conversation that frequently comes up is Dimensions vs Properties and when you should use one verus the other.
Naming Conventions for Tagging with OpenTelemetry and SplunkWhen deploying OpenTelemetry in a large organization, it’s critical to define a standardized naming convention for tagging, and a governance process to ensure the convention is adhered to.</description></item><item><title>Workshop Setup</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.46/en/workshop-setup/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.46/en/workshop-setup/index.html</guid><description>Welcome to the Observability Workshop Setup Guide.
