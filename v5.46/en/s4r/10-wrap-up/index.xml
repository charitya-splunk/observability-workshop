We have a better understanding of the Main User interface and its components, the Landing, Infrastructure, APM, RUM, Synthetics, Dashboard pages, and a quick peek at the Settings page. Depending on time, we did an Infrastructure exercise and looked at Metrics used in the Kubernetes Navigators and saw related services found on our Kubernetes cluster: Understood what users were experiencing and used RUM &amp;amp; APM to Troubleshoot a particularly long page load, by following its trace across the front and back end and right to the log entries.</description></item></channel></rss>
