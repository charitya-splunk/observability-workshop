This is important so you&amp;rsquo;re not carrying cookies into the recording, that we won&amp;rsquo;t have set up in the Synthetic test by default. If you would prefer to start on a demo site, feel free to use https://frontend-eu.splunko11y.com or https://frontend-us.splunko11y.com, which we are using in the examples below.
Have in mind a short user journey you want to test.</description></item><item><title>1.2 Create Real Browser Test</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.39/en/scenarios/3-optimize-end-user-experiences/2-synthetics/2-browser/2-create-real-browser-test/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.39/en/scenarios/3-optimize-end-user-experiences/2-synthetics/2-browser/2-create-real-browser-test/index.html</guid><description>In Splunk Observability Cloud, navigate to Synthetics and click on Add new test .

To enable the Import button, we must first give our test a name e.g. &amp;lt;your initials&amp;gt; - Online Boutique.
Once the Import button is enabled, click on it and either drop the JSON file that you exported from the Chrome DevTools Recorder or upload the file.
Once the JSON file has been uploaded, click on Continue to edit steps Before we make any edits to the test, let&amp;rsquo;s first configure the settings, click on &amp;lt; Return to test</description></item><item><title>1.4 Settings</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.39/en/scenarios/3-optimize-end-user-experiences/2-synthetics/2-browser/4-edit-test-settings/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.39/en/scenarios/3-optimize-end-user-experiences/2-synthetics/2-browser/4-edit-test-settings/index.html</guid><description>The simple settings allow you to configure the basics of the test:
Name: The name of the test (e.g. RWC - Online Boutique). Details: Locations: The locations where the test will run from. Device: Emulate different devices and connection speeds. Also, the viewport will be adjusted to match the chosen device. Frequency: How often the test will run. Round-robin: If multiple locations are selected, the test will run from one location at a time, rather than all locations at once.</description></item><item><title>1.5 Advanced Settings</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.39/en/scenarios/3-optimize-end-user-experiences/2-synthetics/2-browser/5-advanced-settings/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.39/en/scenarios/3-optimize-end-user-experiences/2-synthetics/2-browser/5-advanced-settings/index.html</guid><description>Click on Advanced, these settings are optional and can be used to further configure the test.
Note In the case of this workshop, we will not be using any of these settings as this is for informational purposes only.
Security: TLS/SSL validation: When activated, this feature is used to enforce the validation of expired, invalid hostname, or untrusted issuer on SSL/TLS certificates. Authentication: Add credentials to authenticate with sites that require additional security protocols, for example from within a corporate network.</description></item><item><title>1.6 Edit test steps</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.39/en/scenarios/3-optimize-end-user-experiences/2-synthetics/2-browser/6-edit-steps/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.39/en/scenarios/3-optimize-end-user-experiences/2-synthetics/2-browser/6-edit-steps/index.html</guid><description>To edit the steps click on the + Edit steps or synthetic transactions button. From here, we are going to give meaningful names to each step.
For each of the four steps, we are going to give them a meaningful, readable name. For our demo site, that looks like:
Step 1 replace the text Go to URL with HomePage - Online Boutique Step 2 enter the text Select Vintage Camera Lens.</description></item><item><title>1.7 View test results</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.39/en/scenarios/3-optimize-end-user-experiences/2-synthetics/2-browser/7-view-test-results/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.39/en/scenarios/3-optimize-end-user-experiences/2-synthetics/2-browser/7-view-test-results/index.html</guid><description>1. Click into a spike or failure in your test run results.
