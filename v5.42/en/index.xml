In this workshop, we will be showing how Splunk Observability Cloud provides instant visibility of the user experience – from the perspective of the front-end application to its back-end services – Letting you experience some of the most compelling product features and differentiators of Splunk Observability Cloud:
Infrastructure Monitoring Full-fidelity Real User Monitoring (RUM) Complete end-to-end NoSample™ Full-fidelity trace visibility with Application Performance Monitoring (APM) No code log querying Synthetic Monitoring Finding root causes with tag analytics and error stacks Related content A key factor in building the Splunk Observability Cloud is to unify telemetry data to create a complete picture of an end-user experience and your application stack.</description></item><item><title>Scenarios</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.42/en/scenarios/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.42/en/scenarios/index.html</guid><description>Optimize Cloud MonitoringTBD
Understand Impact of Changes2 minutes AuthorsDerek Mitchell Splunk Observability Cloud includes powerful features that dramatically reduce the time required for SREs to isolate issues across services, so they know which team to engage to troubleshoot the issue further, and can provide context to help engineering get a head start on debugging. Unlocking these features requires tags to be included with your application traces. But how do you know which tags are the most valuable and how do you capture them?</description></item><item><title>Ninja Workshops</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.42/en/other/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.42/en/other/index.html</guid><description>Splunk IMSplunk delivers real-time monitoring and troubleshooting to help you maximize infrastructure performance with complete visibility.
