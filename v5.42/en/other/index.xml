To simplify the workshop modules, a pre-configured AWS/EC2 instance is provided.
The instance is pre-configured with all the software required to deploy the Splunk OpenTelemetry Connector2 in Kubernetes, deploy an NGINX^3 ReplicaSet^4 and finally deploy a microservices-based application which has been instrumented using OpenTelemetry to send metrics, traces, spans and logs3.</description></item><item><title>Splunk APM</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.42/en/other/2-apm/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.42/en/other/2-apm/index.html</guid><description>Splunk APM is a NoSample™ Full-fidelity application performance monitoring and troubleshooting solution for cloud-native, microservices-based applications.
By collecting all traces, instead of a sampled subset, no anomaly goes undetected. Whether a user experiences an error or longer-than-usual latency, you’ll be able to know and act on it within seconds. Furthermore, not all bad behavior results in errors — as your developers create new applications they need to know whether their canary releases provide the expected results.</description></item><item><title>Auto-Instrumentation Workshops</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.42/en/other/3-auto-instrumentation/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.42/en/other/3-auto-instrumentation/index.html</guid><description>PetClinic Java Workshop (Monolith)A workshop using Zero Configuration Auto-Instrumentation for Java.

During the workshop you will deploy PHP/Apache and a load generator.
You will learn about OpenTelemetry Receivers, Kubernetes Namespaces, ReplicaSets, Kubernetes Horizontal Pod AutoScaling and how to monitor all this using the Splunk Observability Cloud. The main learnings from the workshop will be a better understanding of the Kubernetes Navigator (and Dashboards) in Splunk Observability Cloud as well as seeing Kubernetes metrics, events and Detectors.</description></item><item><title>Making Your Observability Cloud Native With OpenTelemetry</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.42/en/other/5-opentelemetry-collector/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.42/en/other/5-opentelemetry-collector/index.html</guid><description>Abstract Organizations getting started with OpenTelemetry may begin by sending data directly to an observability backend. While this works well for initial testing, using the OpenTelemetry collector as part of your observability architecture provides numerous benefits and is recommended for any production deployment.
In this workshop, we will be focusing on using the OpenTelemetry collector and starting with the fundamentals of configuring the receivers, processors, and exporters ready to use with Splunk Observability Cloud.</description></item><item><title>Build a Distributed Trace in Lambda and Kinesis</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.42/en/other/6-lambda-kinesis/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.42/en/other/6-lambda-kinesis/index.html</guid><description>45 minutes This workshop will equip you with how a distributed trace is constructed for a small serverless application that runs on AWS Lambda, producing and consuming a message via AWS Kinesis.
We will see how auto-instrumentation works with manual steps to force a Producer function&amp;rsquo;s context to be sent to Consumer function via a Record put on a Kinesis stream.
For this workshop Splunk has prepared an Ubuntu Linux instance in AWS/EC2 all pre-configured for you.</description></item><item><title>Improving MTTR with Custom Tags</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.42/en/other/7-mttr-custom-tags/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.42/en/other/7-mttr-custom-tags/index.html</guid><description>45 minutes This workshop will:
