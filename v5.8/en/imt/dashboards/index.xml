Adding Notes Often on dashboards it makes sense to place a short &amp;ldquo;instruction&amp;rdquo; pane that helps users of a dashboard. Lets add one now by clicking on the New Text Note Button.
This will open the notes editor.
To allow you to add more then just text to you notes, Splunk is allowing you to use Markdown in these notes/panes. Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using plain-text often used in Webpages.</description></item></channel></rss>
