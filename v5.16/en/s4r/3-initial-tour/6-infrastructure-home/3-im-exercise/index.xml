In the Kubernetes Navigator, the cluster is represented by the square with the black line around it and will contain one or more blue squares representing the node(s), each of them containing one or more colored boxes that represent pods. And, as you can guess, green means healthy and red means that there is a problem.</description></item><item><title>Splunk Infrastructure exercise with the Kubernetes Navigator</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.16/en/s4r/3-initial-tour/6-infrastructure-home/3-im-exercise/2-im-excersise/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.16/en/s4r/3-initial-tour/6-infrastructure-home/3-im-exercise/2-im-excersise/index.html</guid><description>10 minutes Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some other parts of the UI like the Information Pane on the right of the navigator or the Related Content Pane at the bottom.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the Information Pane, this pane provides alert and detected services information and the metadata related to the object you&amp;rsquo;re looking at.
Meta Data is sent along with the metrics and is very useful for identifying trends when looking into issues.</description></item></channel></rss>
