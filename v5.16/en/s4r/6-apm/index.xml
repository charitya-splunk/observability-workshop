The map is dynamically generated based on your selections in the time range, environment, workflow, service, and tag filters.
When we clicked on the APM link in the RUM waterfall, filters were automatically added to the service map view to show the services that were involved in that particular trace.
You can use the service map to identify dependencies, performance bottlenecks, and error propagation.</description></item><item><title>2. APM Service Dashboard</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.16/en/s4r/6-apm/2-apm-service-dashboard/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.16/en/s4r/6-apm/2-apm-service-dashboard/index.html</guid><description>Splunk APM provides a set of built-in dashboards that present charts and visualized metrics to help you see problems occurring in real time and quickly determine whether the problem is associated with a service, a specific endpoint, or the underlying infrastructure.
APM dashboards present request, error, and duration (RED) metrics based on Monitoring MetricSets created from endpoint spans for your services, endpoints, and Business Workflows. They also present related host and Kubernetes metrics to help you determine whether problems are related to the underlying infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>3.

You will be presented with the full service map which now includes all services (including inferred services). Inferred services are visually represented by a dotted outline.
Exercise How many services are there in total? Click on the mysql:LxvGChW075 inferred database. Scroll down the right side functions pane, and under Database Query Performance click on the top entry.</description></item><item><title>4.

APM Trace Analyzer</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.16/en/s4r/6-apm/6-apm-trace-analyzer/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.16/en/s4r/6-apm/6-apm-trace-analyzer/index.html</guid><description>In the right-hand pane, click on Traces. To ensure we are using Trace Analyzer make sure the button Switch to Classic View is showing. If it is not, click on Switch to Trace Analyzer .
Splunk Observability Cloud provides several tools for exploring application monitoring data. Trace Analyzer is suited to scenarios where you have high-cardinality, high-granularity searches and explorations to research unknown or new issues.
In Trace Analyzer you can filter traces by any indexed/unindexed span tag.</description></item><item><title>7.

A trace is a collection of spans that share the same trace ID, representing a unique transaction handled by your application and its constituent services.
Each span in Splunk APM captures a single operation. Splunk APM considers a span to be an error span if the operation that the span captures results in an error.
