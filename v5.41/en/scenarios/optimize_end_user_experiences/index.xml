We can capture not only the performance and availability of our own apps and endpoints, but also those third parties we rely on any time of the day or night.
Tip If you find that your tests are being bot-blocked, see the docs for tips on how to allow Synthetics testing.</description></item><item><title>RUM</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.41/en/scenarios/optimize_end_user_experiences/2-rum/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.41/en/scenarios/optimize_end_user_experiences/2-rum/index.html</guid><description>With RUM instrumented, we will be able to better understand our end users, what they are doing, and what issues they are encountering.
This workshop walks through how our demo site is instrumented and how to interpret the data. If you already have a RUM license, this will help you understand how RUM works and how you can use it to optimize your end user experience.
Our Docs also contain guidance such as scenarios using Splunk RUM and demo applications to test out RUM for mobile apps.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Synthetics</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.41/en/scenarios/optimize_end_user_experiences/3-advanced-synthetics/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.41/en/scenarios/optimize_end_user_experiences/3-advanced-synthetics/index.html</guid><description>Introduction This workshop walks you through using the Chrome DevTools Recorder to create a synthetic test on a Splunk demonstration environment or on your own public website.
The exported JSON from the Chrome DevTools Recorder will then be used to create a Splunk Synthetic Monitoring Real Browser Test.
Pre-requisites Google Chrome Browser installed Publicly browser-accessible URL Access to Splunk Observability Cloud Goals of Synthetics Proactively monitor the performance of your web app before problems affect your users.</description></item><item><title>Frontend Dashboards</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.41/en/scenarios/optimize_end_user_experiences/4-dashboards/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.41/en/scenarios/optimize_end_user_experiences/4-dashboards/index.html</guid><description>Provide a dashboard group for the workshop.</description></item><item><title>Detectors</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.41/en/scenarios/optimize_end_user_experiences/5-detectors/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.41/en/scenarios/optimize_end_user_experiences/5-detectors/index.html</guid><description>After we have a good understanding of our performance baseline, we can start to create Detectors so that we receive alerts when our KPIs are unexpected. If we create detectors before understanding our baseline, we run the risk of generating unnecessary alert noise.
For RUM and Synthetics, we will explore how to create detectors:
on a single Synthetic test
on a single KPI in RUM
on a dashboard chart
For more Detector resources, please see our Observability docs, Lantern, and consider an Education course if you&amp;rsquo;d like to go more in depth with instructor guidance.</description></item></channel></rss>
