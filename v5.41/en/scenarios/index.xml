Splunk Observability Cloud includes powerful features that dramatically reduce the time required for SREs to isolate issues across services, so they know which team to engage to troubleshoot the issue further, and can provide context to help engineering get a head start on debugging.
Unlocking these features requires tags to be included with your application traces. But how do you know which tags are the most valuable and how do you capture them?</description></item><item><title>Debug Problems in Microservices</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.41/en/scenarios/debug_problems/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.41/en/scenarios/debug_problems/index.html</guid><description>2 minutes AuthorsDerek Mitchell
Service Maps and Traces are extremely valuable in determining what service an issue resides in. And related log data helps provide detail on why issues are occurring in that service.
But engineers sometimes need to go even deeper to debug a problem thatâ€™s occurring in one of their services.
This is where features such as Splunk&amp;rsquo;s AlwaysOn Profiling and Database Query Performance come in.
AlwaysOn Profiling continuously collects stack traces so that you can discover which lines in your code are consuming the most CPU and memory.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing End User Experiences</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.41/en/scenarios/optimize_end_user_experiences/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.41/en/scenarios/optimize_end_user_experiences/index.html</guid><description>How we can use Splunk Observability to get insight into end user experience, and proactively test scenarios to improve that experience.
