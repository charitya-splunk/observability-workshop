Splunk indexes Generally, in Splunk, an “index” refers to a designated place where your data is stored. It’s like a folder or container for your data. Data within a Splunk index is organized and structured in a way that makes it easy to search and analyze. Different indexes can be created to store specific types of data. For example, you might have one index for web server logs, another for application logs, and so on.</description></item></channel></rss>
