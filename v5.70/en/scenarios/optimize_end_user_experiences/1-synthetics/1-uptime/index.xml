This lightweight test can run internally or externally around the world, as frequently as every minute. Because this is the easiest (and cheapest!) test to set up, and because this is ideal for monitoring availability of your most critical enpoints and ports, let’s start here.
Pre-requisites Publicly accessible HTTP(S) endpoint(s) to test Access to Splunk Observability Cloud</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><atom:link href="https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.70/en/scenarios/optimize_end_user_experiences/1-synthetics/1-uptime/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>Creating a test</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.70/en/scenarios/optimize_end_user_experiences/1-synthetics/1-uptime/1-create-uptime/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.70/en/scenarios/optimize_end_user_experiences/1-synthetics/1-uptime/1-create-uptime/index.html</guid><description>Open Synthetics Click the Add new test button on the right side of the screen, then select Uptime and HTTP test. Name your test with your team name (provided by your workshop instructor), your initials, and any other details you’d like to include, like geographic region.
For now let’s test a GET request. Fill in the URL field. You can use one of your own, or one of ours like https://online-boutique-eu.splunko11y.com, https://online-boutique-us.splunko11y.com, or https://www.splunk.com.</description></item><item><title>Understanding results</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.70/en/scenarios/optimize_end_user_experiences/1-synthetics/1-uptime/2-understand-uptime-results/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.70/en/scenarios/optimize_end_user_experiences/1-synthetics/1-uptime/2-understand-uptime-results/index.html</guid><description>Click into a test summary view and play with the Performance KPIs chart filters to see how you can slice and dice your data. This is a good place to get started understanding trends. Later, we will see what custom charts look like, so you can tailor dashboards to the KPIs you care about most. Workshop Question: Using the Performance KPIs chart What metrics are available? Is your data consistent across time and locations? Do certain locations run slower than others? Are there any spikes or failures?</description></item></channel></rss>
