Take, for instance, a team containerizing five workloads on AWS requiring EKS visibility. Usually, this involves assisting with integration setup, configuring metadata, and creating dashboards and alerts—a process that’s both time-consuming and increases administrative overhead and technical debt.
Splunk Observability Cloud was designed to handle customers with a diverse set of technical requirements and stacks – from monolithic to microservices architectures, from homegrown applications to Software-as-a-Service.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><atom:link href="https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.70/en/scenarios/optimize_monitoring/2-standardize-data-collection/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>What Are Tags?</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.70/en/scenarios/optimize_monitoring/2-standardize-data-collection/1-what-are-tags/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.70/en/scenarios/optimize_monitoring/2-standardize-data-collection/1-what-are-tags/index.html</guid><description>Tags are key-value pairs that provide additional metadata about metrics, spans in a trace, or logs allowing you to enrich the context of the data you send to Splunk Observability Cloud. Many tags are collected by default such as hostname or OS type. Custom tags can be used to provide environment or application-specific context. Examples of custom tags include:
Infrastructure specific attributes What data center a host is in What services are hosted on an instance What team is responsible for a set of hosts Application specific attributes What Application Version is running Feature flags or experimental identifiers Tenant ID in multi-tenant applications User related attributes User ID User role (e.g. admin, guest, subscriber) User geographical location (e.g. country, city, region) There are two ways to add tags to your data Add tags as OpenTelemetry attributes to metrics, traces, and logs when you send data to the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector. This option lets you add spans in bulk. Instrument your application to create span tags. This option gives you the most flexibility at the per-application level. Why are tags so important? Tags are essential for an application to be truly observable. Tags add context to the traces to help us understand why some users get a great experience and others don’t. Powerful features in Splunk Observability Cloud utilize tags to help you jump quickly to the root cause.</description></item><item><title>Adding Context With Tags</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.70/en/scenarios/optimize_monitoring/2-standardize-data-collection/2-adding-context-with-tags/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.70/en/scenarios/optimize_monitoring/2-standardize-data-collection/2-adding-context-with-tags/index.html</guid><description>When you deployed the OpenTelemetry Demo Application in the Getting Started section of this workshop, you were asked to enter your favorite city. For this workshop, we’ll be using that to show the value of custom tags.
For this workshop, the OpenTelemetry collector is pre-configured to use the city you provided as a custom tag called store.location which will be used to emulate Kubernetes Clusters running in different geographic locations. We’ll use this tag as a filter to show how you can use Out-of-the-Box integration dashboards to quickly create views for specific teams, applications, or other attributes about your environment. Efficiently enabling content to be reused across teams without increasing technical debt.</description></item></channel></rss>
