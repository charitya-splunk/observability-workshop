To simplify the workshop modules, a pre-configured AWS/EC2 instance is provided.
The instance is pre-configured with all the software required to deploy the Splunk OpenTelemetry Connector2 and the microservices-based OpenTelemetry Demo Application3 in Kubernetes which has been instrumented using OpenTelemetry to send metrics, traces, spans and logs.
This workshop will introduce you to the benefits of standardized data collection, how content can be re-used across teams, correlating metrics and logs, and creating detectors to fire alerts. By the end of these technical workshops, you will have a good understanding of some of the key features and capabilities of the Splunk Observability Cloud.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><atom:link href="https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.70/en/scenarios/optimize_monitoring/1-getting-started/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>How to connect to your workshop environment</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.70/en/scenarios/optimize_monitoring/1-getting-started/1-access-ec2/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.70/en/scenarios/optimize_monitoring/1-getting-started/1-access-ec2/index.html</guid><description>How to retrieve the IP address of the AWS/EC2 instance assigned to you. Connect to your instance using SSH, Putty1 or your web browser. Verify your connection to your AWS/EC2 cloud instance. Using Putty (Optional) Using Multipass (Optional) 1. AWS/EC2 IP Address In preparation for the workshop, Splunk has prepared an Ubuntu Linux instance in AWS/EC2.

This application is for an online retailer and includes more than a dozen services written in many different languages. While metrics, traces, and logs are being collected from this application, this workshop is primarily focused on how Splunk Observability Cloud can be used to more efficiently monitor infrastructure.
Pre-requisites You should have access to the EC2 instance provided in section 1.1 Access AWS/EC2 Instance Initial Steps The initial setup can be completed by executing the following steps on the command line of your EC2 instance.</description></item></channel></rss>
