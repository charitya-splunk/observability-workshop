The goal is to walk through the basic steps to configure the following components of the Splunk Observability Cloud platform:
Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring (IM) Splunk Zero Configuration Auto Instrumentation for NodeJS (APM) AlwaysOn Profiling Splunk Log Observer (LO) We will deploy the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop application in Kubernetes, which contains two NodeJS services (Frontend &amp;amp; Payment Service). Once the application and the OpenTelemetry Connector are up and running, we will start seeing metrics, traces and logs via the Zero Configuration Auto Instrumentation for NodeJS that will be used by the Splunk Observability Cloud platform to provide insights into the application.</description></item><item><title>Workshop using the Java microservices Pet Clinic demo (Kubernetes based).</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.38/en/other/3-auto-instrumentation/3-java-microservices-pet-clinic/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.38/en/other/3-auto-instrumentation/3-java-microservices-pet-clinic/index.html</guid><description>The goal of this workshop is to introduce the features of Splunk&amp;rsquo;s Opentelemetry Java Auto instrumentation. First we walk through the basic steps to enable auto-instrumentation for an existing Java application running in Kubernetes so it will start sending Opentelemetry signals to Splunk Observability Cloud platform and enable the following components:
Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring (IM) Splunk Auto Instrumentation for Java (APM) Database Query Performance AlwaysOn Profiling Splunk Real User Monitoring (RUM) RUM to APM Correlation Splunk Log Observer (LO) We will show the steps about how to clone (download) a sample microservices Java application (Spring PetClinic), as well as how to compile, package and deploy/run the application.</description></item></channel></rss>
