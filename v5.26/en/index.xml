Infrastructure Monitoring Full-fidelity Real User Monitoring (RUM) Complete end-to-end NoSample™ Full-fidelity trace visibility with Application Performance Monitoring (APM) No code log querying Synthetic Monitoring Finding root causes with tag analytics and error stacks Related content A key factor in building the Splunk Observability Cloud is to unify telemetry data to create a complete picture of an end-user experience and your application stack.</description></item><item><title>Splunk IM</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.26/en/imt/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.26/en/imt/index.html</guid><description>During this technical Splunk Observability Cloud Infrastructure Monitoring and APM Workshop, you will build out an environment based on a lightweight Kubernetes1 cluster.
To simplify the workshop modules, a pre-configured AWS/EC2 instance is provided.
The instance is pre-configured with all the software required to deploy the Splunk OpenTelemetry Connector2 in Kubernetes, deploy an NGINX^3 ReplicaSet^4 and finally deploy a microservices-based application which has been instrumented using OpenTelemetry to send metrics, traces, spans and logs3.</description></item><item><title>Splunk APM</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.26/en/apm/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.26/en/apm/index.html</guid><description>Splunk APM is a NoSample™ Full-fidelity application performance monitoring and troubleshooting solution for cloud-native, microservices-based applications.
By collecting all traces, instead of a sampled subset, no anomaly goes undetected. Whether a user experiences an error or longer-than-usual latency, you’ll be able to know and act on it within seconds. Furthermore, not all bad behavior results in errors — as your developers create new applications they need to know whether their canary releases provide the expected results.</description></item><item><title>Ninja Workshops</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.26/en/other/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.26/en/other/index.html</guid><description>PetClinic Java WorkshopA workshop using Zero Configuration Auto-Instrumentation for Java.

Dimension, Properties and TagsOne conversation that frequently comes up is Dimensions vs Properties and when you should use one verus the other.
Naming Conventions for Tagging with OpenTelemetry and SplunkWhen deploying OpenTelemetry in a large organization, it’s critical to define a standardized naming convention for tagging, and a governance process to ensure the convention is adhered to.</description></item><item><title>Workshop Setup</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.26/en/workshop-setup/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.26/en/workshop-setup/index.html</guid><description>Workshop Setup Steps Available Workshop Orgs The following Organizations are used for running Observability Workshops.
